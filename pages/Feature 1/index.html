Over the river that runs diagonally from top left to bottom right, you’ll find the Dire lands on the right side of the map, all covered in bugs and stuff.</p>

                <h1>Crownfall Act III and Collector's Cache</h1>
                <p>June has come and, as it tends to do, now left us, probably forever. You'd be forgiven for forgetting all about crowns and them falling dramatically from the heads of fantasy birds and just enjoying your summer — slowing down, taking it easy, having a picnic at the beach, or just napping for a while in a hammock. Well, we hope you enjoyed it, because July has come roaring into all of our lives, and with it, Crownfall Act III: The Frosts of Icewrack. In fact, the lazy, meandering intro to this blog post is probably all the lounging around your poor eyeballs are going to get. Even as this June-esque paragraph winds its way towards a rambling sun-dappled conclusion, Act III is ramping up, July-like, to be the most eventful act yet.</p>

                <h1>Introducing the Steam Game Recording Beta</h1>
                <p>There are millions of Dota players around the world, and every day their adventures offer up experiences ranging from universal (a savvy swipe of an Aegis) to one-in-a-billion (a RAMPAGE by Chen) — including thrilling moments, silly moments, and everything in between. And since the only thing as fun as playing Dota is savoring those signature plays with friends, today we're excited to roll out Game Recording, a new built-in Steam feature that makes sharing those special Dota moments easier than ever before.</p>

                <p>The regional battles on the Road to The International have concluded, and we now know all sixteen teams destined to clash in Copenhagen this September. But there's also another competition to remember — in which the auteurs of the Dota scene grab their pens, friends, and camera lenses and treat the community to a breadth of cinema that rivals any film festival.</p>

                    <p>
                        Shields his allies or himself from attacks. Unlike the other scions of his house, Abaddon drank deeper than any from the prophetic vapors that flowed from the Font of Avernus. Now a being of unnatural powers, Abaddon stifles his foes by spreading the Curse of Avernus, and releases deathly double-edged Mist Coils to damage adversaries and heal allies. The black mist swirls around his compatriots, forming an Aphotic Shield that absorbs attacks before bursting in a wide radius. But the Font's greatest gift is revealed only in the desperation of battle. Bestowed with Borrowed Time, Abaddon charges the enemy ranks, riding down foes with his cursed blade, his health returning with each welcoming blow. For all that was meant to kill did nothing but make the Lord of Avernus even more formidable.

                        Slashes his foes with mana-draining attacks. Among the ascetic monks of Turstarkuri, only a young acolyte was fortunate enough to escape the fallen legion's assault on the monastery. Now, vowing to eliminate not only the magic of the Dead God, the Anti-Mage returns to eradicate magic altogether. With sheer focus, he Counters Spells thrown at him and his Allies, returning them to their senders. No wizard's trick is enough to contain or elude the Anti-Mage, as he Blinks out of any trap, while at the same time being capable of sending a Fragments of himself to pursue targets in return. With each swing of his unorthodox blades, the Anti-Mage steps closer to his goal of erradicating all magic, Breaking apart Mana, setting up the depleted caster to perish in a crushing Mana Void.

                        Chases down his enemies to weaken and bash them. Born under the immense pressure of the deep, always ready to find and demolish his foes, Slardar quickly slithers and Sprints into battle with one muscular tail, chasing down legged foes with alarming swiftness. And with little time to react, they were bathed with his Corrosive Haze, exposing their position while shattering their defenses. Once discovered, the Slithereen Guard Smashes the Ground, dazing nearby enemies just long enough to pummel and Macerate them.

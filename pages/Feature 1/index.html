He developed an admiration for Yuujirou, and now he travels, fighting with him on the battlefields across the world. He somewhat understands Yuujirou's mentality and mentions that he is the only person to bring the United States to its knees. However, it is often seen that Strydum cannot stand situations in which Yuujirou abuses his brutality and ruthlessness. He seems to know him well and understand his wild way of thinking, but he usually disagrees with his actions. Strydum is also a friend and mentor of Baki's, who keeps him up to date about Yuujirou's whereabouts.
